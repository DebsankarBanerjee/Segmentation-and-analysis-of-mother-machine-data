# Segmentation and analysis of mother machine data (SAM)
Bacterial cell segmentation in mother machine data using MATLAB
# To run in MATLAB console:
	Open MATLAB in /code folder path
1. all .tif files should be in /im folder

2. write the filenames in the file code/dataname
   example: if the files in "im" folder are xy01_01.tif and xy01_02.tif then the dataname file should be

xy01_01
xy01_02

3. run SAM.m in the MATLAB console

4. the folders "data" and "plot" should exist for writing data and plotting frames
   run  > mkdir plot and > mkdir data to create them from console.
